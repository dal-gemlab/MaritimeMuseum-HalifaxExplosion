	"description": "The Tufts Cove Generating Station provides the Halifax Regional Municipality with electrical power. <br/><br/>A thermal generating station, Tufts Cove was constructed in 1965 by the Nova Scotia Light and Power Company Limited. Part of a historic neighbourhood was demolished to locate the facility on the eastern shore of Halifax Harbour. Now operated by Nova Scotia Power, many recent upgrades have dramatically improved its environmental performance. The plant features three distinctive red-striped 150m (500 ft) chimneys, a landmark on the Halifax harbour.",
