	"description": "In the decades since the explosion, the graving dock and shipyard businesses grew, and now they are both part of the Irving empire. The Irving Shipyard is where Canadaâ€™s east coast Navy procurement program is centred; Arctic patrol vessels are being assembled here now. They will play an important role in the Canadian Arctic, as climate change frees up the waterways, and resources, that are now locked in ice. </br></br>Ground Zero, where the SS Mont-Blanc exploded, is next to where Pier 6 stood at the foot of Richmond Street. This location is now within the Halifax Shipyard, Irving Shipbuilding Inc., although the exact location remains unmarked.",
