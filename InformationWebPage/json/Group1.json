    "description": "The Halifax Explosion Memorial Bell Tower sits atop a hill in Fort Needham Park, facing Ground Zero of the explosion. The monument was designed by the Core Design Group, who were awarded the project in a December 1983 competition among local architects. Designer Keith Graham used circle, triangle and ivy motifs in the design; he stated that the finished monument was meant to convey a feeling for the past, with hope for the future. <br/><br/>The Halifax Explosion memorial bells were installed in 1985, relocating carillon bells from a nearby church to the large concrete sculpture. <br/><br/>This is the location of an annual civic memorial ceremony held every December 6, and a new plaza surrounding the tower was finished for the 2017 centenary",
