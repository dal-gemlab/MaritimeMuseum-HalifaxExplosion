	"description": "The Halifax Explosion Memorial Bell Tower sits atop a hill in Fort Needham Park. The monument was designed by the Core Design Group, who were awarded the project in a December 1983 competition among local architects. Using circle, triangle and ivy motifs in the design, Core designer Keith Graham stated that the finished monument was meant to convey a feeling for the past, with hope for the future. </br></br>The Halifax Explosion memorial bells were installed in 1985, relocating carillon bells from a nearby church to the large concrete sculpture on Fort Needham Hill, intended to face the Ground Zero of the explosion. </br></br>This view has been recently blocked with the building of the Shipyard building. This is the location of an annual civic memorial ceremony held every December 6, and a new plaza surrounding the tower was finished for the 2017 centenary",
