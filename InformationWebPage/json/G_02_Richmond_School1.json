	"description": "Just months prior to the explosion, a new section of the school on Roome Street had been opened to accommodate a growing student population. Although much of the building was destroyed during the explosion, most students werenâ€™t yet at school, since class only started at full light in the winter.<br/><br/>Debris from the explosion was often reused during the reconstruction. Some of the stone work in local gardens was recovered from the foundation of the former Roome Street School. Architect Andrew R. Cobb designed the new Richmond School, completed in 1919, using some of the recovered bricks from the original school. The building now houses the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Family Division.",
