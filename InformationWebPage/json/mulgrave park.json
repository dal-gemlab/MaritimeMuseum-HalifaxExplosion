	"description": "The Mulgrave Park housing development was built as part of Halifax’s 'urban renewal' in the early 1960s. Mulgrave Park is the largest residential development close to Ground Zero. 'The slope of the site would require terracing and retaining walls, which were used to define parking and play areas. After its completion in October 1960, the Mulgrave Park project won numerous awards for its quality.’ (Peter Ziebrowski, builtHalifax.ca). <br/><br/>Mulgrave Park is home to many Haligonians. Adults, youth and children from this busy neighbourhood participate in activities organized by community organizations such as the Mulgrave Park Caring & Learning Centre, the Phoenix Youth program, Progress in the Park, and 4Cs community art projects.",
