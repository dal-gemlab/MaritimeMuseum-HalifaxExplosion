	"description": "The XZY marker is a ‘counter-monument’ made by students in a Dalhousie University School of Architecture Design and Build Freelab course in the summer of 2014. The sculptural design references the use of X, Y and Z coordinates in 3D CAD drawing, and also hearkens back to the house foundations and chimneys left on the Richmond slope after the explosion. </br></br>During the explosion, many people lost their eyesight, and in recognition of this, the XYZ marker lists the names of the known dead in Braille. After the explosion, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind established strong roots here.",
