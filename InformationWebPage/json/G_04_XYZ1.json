	"description": "The XZY marker is a ‘counter-monument’ made by Dalhousie University School of Architecture students as part of Design and Build Freelab course during the summer of 2014. The sculptural design references the use of X, Y and Z coordinates in 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software, and also hearkens back to the house foundations and chimneys left on the Richmond slope after the explosion. <br/><br/>During the explosion, many people lost their eyesight, and in recognition of this, the XYZ marker lists the names of the known dead in Braille. After the explosion, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind established strong roots here.",
