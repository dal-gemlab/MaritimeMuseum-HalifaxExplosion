	"description": "‘Graving dock’ is another phrase for ‘dry dock’; to ‘grave’ something is to lay it down. <br/><br/>The graving dock survived the explosion, with very little damage. This photograph is from the Nova Scotia Archives, Notman Studio collection, and shows the graving dock just after the explosion. <br/><br/>The graving dock is a National Engineers’ Historic Site, however no photos can be taken at this site since it is still in use.",
