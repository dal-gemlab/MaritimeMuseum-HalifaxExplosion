    "description": "Dominion Textiles Cotton Mill once stood at the corner of Young and Robie, and at the time of the explosion took up the entire block. It produced plain cotton with a workforce of 600, half of them women, some under the age of 16. Many workers lost their lives here when the building collapsed. <br/><br/>The freestanding walls and chimney were incorporated into a Building Supply depot for the reconstruction. This became known as Piercy's Lumber and Building Supply, which was a local landmark. It has since been taken over by Rona, who subsequently demolished the original building and tower. <br/><br/>Today, industry, housing and commerce continue to co-exist in the North End of Halifax.",
