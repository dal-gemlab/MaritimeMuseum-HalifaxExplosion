	"description": "Young and Robie is where the Dominion Textiles Cotton Mill once stood. The Dominion Textiles Cotton Mill took up the whole block at the time of the explosion. It produced plain cotton with a workforce of 600, half of them women, some under the age of 16. Many workers lost their lives here when the building collapsed. </br></br>The freestanding walls and chimney were incorporated into a Building Supply depot for the reconstruction. This became known as Piercy's Lumber and Building Supply, which was a local landmark. It has since been taken over by Rona, who subsequently demolished the original building and tower. </br></br>Today, industry, housing and commerce continue to co-exist in the North End.",
