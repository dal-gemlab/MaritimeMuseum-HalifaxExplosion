	"description": "Halifax was the Atlantic seaboard's primary cable ship port and service call depot for the transatlantic cable industry. The French Cable Wharf building is at the bottom of Grove Street, on the Dartmouth side of the harbour. It was built in 1916 and used by the Compagnie Française Des Câbles Télégraphiques as a base for installing and maintaining transatlantic communications cable. </br></br>Made of reinforced concrete, the building was the only major structure on the Dartmouth shore to survive the explosion. There was a wharf extending from the building into the harbour at that time, later used by the Canadian Navy. A major environmental remediation of the site occurred in 2004. The French Cable Wharf building is a recognized Federal Heritage Building, and is now part of the Defence Research and Development Canada facility at this location.",
