	"description": "This is the location of the Richmond train station, where dispatcher Vince Coleman worked and sent his final message from, warning that the explosion was imminent and that the inbound passenger train should not come into Halifax. When the collision happened and the Mont-Blanc drifted to Pier 6, he realized that a disaster was about to happen. Just minutes before the explosion, he telegraphed this message, warning incoming trains to stay away: ‘Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys.’ Hailed as a hero who lost his life in trying to save others, Vince Coleman’s story was commemorated in a Historica Canada Heritage Minute video from 1991, and one of the new Halifax harbour ferries is named in his honour.",
